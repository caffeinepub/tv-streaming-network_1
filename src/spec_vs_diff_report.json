  "summary": "The diff adds a new SplashView component that displays the exact title text \"TV STREAMING NETWORK\" and integrates a new initial 'splash' view into App.tsx. TopNav is conditionally hidden while on the splash screen, and a button transitions the user into the existing Home view. Admin gating for the Manage view is preserved/strengthened via checks in navigation and an effect redirect.",
